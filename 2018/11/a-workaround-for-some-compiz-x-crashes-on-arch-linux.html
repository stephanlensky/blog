			<h1><a href="#">A Workaround for some Compiz 0.8.x crashes on Arch Linux</a></h1>
			<h2>&mdash; 20 November, 2018</h2>
			<p><strong>TL;DR: Use gtk-window-decorator instead of emerald and theme it using marco</strong></p>

<p>For those who don't know, Compiz is (or was) an extremely popular <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Window_manager">window manager</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">3D compositor</a> for X11
 on Linux. At the height of its popularity in the early-mid 2000s, Compiz's jaw-dropping 3D effects served to show everyone what the Linux Desktop&#8482; was truly capable of.</p>

<span class='caption'>The Compiz desktop cube in all of its glory. Would it be better or worse if I also told you it supported 3D using those old red and blue 3D glasses?</span></p>

<p>X11, originally a protocol intended only to display simple rectangular windows, was not in any way designed to support the eye-catching effects of Compiz. As a result, Compiz's original codebase was built on years of hacks, duct tape, and prayers, and to be honest I think it's a miracle that it runs on modern Linux configs at all. Though a few lone developers still patch the occasional bug in the original 0.8.x codebase (<a href="https://gitlab.com/compiz">Compiz Reloaded</a>), development has for the most part stopped. Few people still care about Compiz at all, and most who do have long since moved on to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/compiz">0.9.x rewrite</a>. Unfortunately, this new version is lacking a number of the purely aesthetic features (not useful ones, to be clear) of the 0.8.x branch.</p>

<p>It should be obvious, then, why I was so sad when Compiz began crashing irrecoverably on my system while pressing Alt+Tab to switch windows.</p>

<h1 id="diagnosing-the-crash-by-looking-at-other-peoples-bug-reports">Diagnosing the crash by looking at other people's bug reports</h1>

<p>As documented <a href="https://gitlab.com/compiz/compiz-core/issues/106">here</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/compiz/compiz-core/issues/107">here</a>, this crash is related to window decoration, and began happening as a result of a recent but unknown change in the Xorg server. For a while, the fixes in <a href="https://github.com/alekseyt/compiz">Alekseyt's fork</a> seemed to fix the crash, but after I updated my system recently the static application switcher is causing freezes again. Considering the state of the Compiz's code and my unfamiliarity with it, I wasn't too eager to dive in and try to fix it again myself. Luckily, a solution I hadn't considered before ended up working perfectly.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to decorate windows in Compiz ("decorating a window" is the process of adding borders, buttons, etc. to it), but the only one anyone really uses anymore is called <a href="http://wiki.compiz.org/Decorators/Emerald">Emerald</a>. Emerald is highly configurable, but, like Compiz, is riddled with bugs. As it turns out, the crash I was experiencing only happens when using Emerald, but before now I hadn't considered the main alternative (gtk-window-decorator). The main reason for this is that there is no easy way to customize its appearance (at least not that I knew of) and it looks like this by default:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/20181120_classic-decorator.jpg" alt="The classic gtk-window-decorator" />
<span class='caption'>Not the worst, but that titlebar <em>does</em> a look a <em>little</em> dated.</span></p>

<p>Luckily, I learned today while digging through <a href="https://github.com/compiz-reloaded/compiz/blob/master/gtk-window-decorator/gtk-window-decorator.c">gtk-window-decorator.c</a> that it actually has some limited support for Marco themes if compiled with a special flag. Marco is the default window manager for the <a href="https://mate-desktop.org/">MATE desktop environment</a>, and there are a number of widely available GTK3 themes for it on sites like <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/cat/135">this</a>. After I putting in a bit of elbow grease modifying <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1013698/">this</a> theme, I actually ended up with something that looked pretty nice (and no longer crashed every five minutes...).</p>

<p><img src="../../img/20181120_rethemed-gtk-decorator.png" alt="My themed gtk-window-decorator" />
<span class='caption'>Much better.</span></p>

<h1 id="how-to-fix-for-arch-but-easily-transferrable">How to fix (for Arch, but easily transferrable)</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Recompile Compiz Reloaded using the <code>--enable-marco</code> and <code>--with-gtk=3.0</code> flags. I found this easiest to do by modifying the PKGBUILD of the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/compiz-core-git/">AUR package</a></p></li>
<li><p>Find a nice looking theme on <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1013698/">gnome-look.org</a>, and extract it to <code>/usr/share/themes</code></p></li>
<li><p>Change the command in the "Window Decoration" plugin in CCSM to <code>gtk-window-decorator --replace --marco-theme theme-name</code>. Alternatively, you can use gsettings to set the default theme by running the following command (courtesy of the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compiz/Configuration#GTK_Window_Decorator">Arch wiki</a>):</p>

<pre><code>$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme theme-name
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you should be good to go. Free from crashes, you should have all the time in the world to show off your aquarium-themed, wobbly-windowed desktop cube to anyone (and everyone) who will listen.</p>

<p>Best,<br>Stephan</p>
